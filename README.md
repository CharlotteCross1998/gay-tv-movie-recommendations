# What is this?
A static website designed to share my reviews on good gay movies/tv shows. 
# FAQ
Why is it in HTML/CSS only? Why no javascript/php/insert other language/library here:

> Because it doesn't need to be fancy. It just needs to convey information

Why is the code so bad? Why are you copy-pasting the review div? Why not use X library/language?

> Because it's based off of an old blog template I made when I was 12, and it does the job. It's why it uses ID's instead of classes for css elements.

How do I contribute a review/recommendation?

> The website is for my own review. You can add suggestions for me to watch on the issues page. To add a show, add an IMDB link and maybe a short summary on why you think I should watch it.

How's it for accessibility?

> The website is designed with accessibility in mind, however I do not have any accessbility requirements myself, so I have no idea if I'm doing a good job or not. If the website has any accessiblity issues then please open an issue.
