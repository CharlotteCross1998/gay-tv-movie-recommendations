		This website was set up as a way to recommend gay movies and TV shows to other gays. We felt this was necessary since if you googled "best LGBT programs", you'd get a load of crap, which, to the surprise of no-one, feels like were recommended by straight people. ChatGPT also suffers from this drawback. 
		<br><br>
		Most gay shows, especially lesbians ones, that are recommended have the same common problems with one another. Due to being lesbians ourselves, we only watch lesbian programs with the exception of a few. Because of this, we use lesbian shows as the basis, and thus construct the following points as they are.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Why most gay shows fail:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>There is very little gayness actually happening</li>
			<li>The woman stops being gay for religious reasons/outside pressure/a man</li>
			<li>Men are often far too involved</li>
			<li>The woman leaves the other woman for a man at the end of it all, for no real reason what so ever</li>
			<li>It was written/directed by a straight man</li>
			<li>It's technically gay but never really explored or focussed on</li>
			<li>It's unrealistic, as in, most of the "drama" that happens is something that would never actually happen</li>
			<li>The women are all cheaters and usually feel bad about it even if partner is abusive</li>
		</ul>
